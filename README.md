# BLADE


Blade is and acronym for Browser Level Ai Detection Extention and is a project i have been devloping for my final year project at university. Its main purpose is to detect signs of phishing within email and as of the current moment im writing this it is only planned to be released on chrominum browsers only du to my currnet lack of experience with many of the area invloved. As when coming up with the idea for this project i wanted to create someting in Cyber areas i have less exposure to, which in this case is ML and browser devlopment
